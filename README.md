# Fork Notes (Preface)

This fork aims to simplify Amazon's [AVS Authorization Mechanism](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/alexa-voice-service/authorize-companion-app.html#sdk).

The setup from the original plugin has also been greatly simplified by:

- baking in both Android and iOS LWA libraries
- updating the plugin config to include automatable steps
- adding cordova hooks for copying API Keys at the prepare step

*NOTE:* The android APIs are targeted for cordova-android 7+

# Cordova Plugin Login with Amazon

A Cordova Plugin for Login with Amazon. Use your Amazon account to authenticate with the app.
This plugin is a wrapper around native android and iOS libraries developed by Amazon.
 
## Prerequisites

- Amazon API keys for both iOS and Android 

- Configuration file for Amazon API keys at the root of your 
project named `amazon-login.config.json`, which should have this format:

```
{
  "android": {
    "debug": {
      "api_key": "eyJhbGc...NHGGqug=="
    },
    "release": {
      "api_key": "eyJhbGc...DFthdeg=="
    }
  },
  "ios": {
    "api_key": "eyJhbGc...WyRg=="
  }
}
```

*NOTE:*
By default, the value of API key from `debug` section will be used for Android.
In order to use API key from `release` section
